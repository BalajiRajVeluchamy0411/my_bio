        description: "In this project, I led the development of a robust restaurant recommendation and sentiment analysis system. Utilizing Python libraries like spaCy, scikit-learn, and Gensim, I performed sentiment analysis on extensive restaurant reviews, gauging customer satisfaction and identifying areas for improvement. Employing advanced NLP techniques, including topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), I uncovered key themes in the reviews to help restaurants tailor their offerings. Additionally, I created recommendation systems using cosine similarity and collaborative filtering algorithms to suggest similar restaurants based on user preferences, enhancing the dining experience and promoting restaurant discovery. Overall, my contributions aimed to optimize customer satisfaction and business success in the restaurant industry through data-driven insights and intelligent recommendation mechanisms.",

Our primary goal was to leverage data-driven insights to enhance product quality and operational efficiency. My core responsibility involved meticulous data cleaning activities on input data sourced from various manufacturing systems and applications. These inputs included sensor data capturing temperature, pressure, dew point, chemical composition, and other critical parameters crucial for predicting manufacturing outcomes based on process parameter changes. Addressing missing values and duplicated mean values in significant rows ensured data accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, I conducted thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to glean deeper insights into the dataset, identifying potential outliers and understanding patterns and trends. This analysis facilitated informed decision-making throughout the project lifecycle. The project culminated in a remarkable 55% reduction in defects in clear glass manufacturing within the 3-4mm class category. Through advanced data analytics techniques and cross-functional collaboration, we successfully identified and addressed key process inefficiencies, resulting in substantial improvements in product quality and operational performance.",
